When attempting to run the performance analysis, the project would run successfully and I'd close it as per instructions, but then the analysis window would claim "0.0 seconds captured" and I'd be unable to see the timeline. I was unable to resolve the problem and did not make it to office hours yet, but will try to come in on Tuesday's office hours.
